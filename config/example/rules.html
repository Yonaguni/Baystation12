<ul>
<li>- <strong>No mass-murder, bombings, floodings, etc by non-antagonists.</strong> This is griefing and will be dealt with accordingly.</li>
<br>
<li>- <strong>RP is enforced.</strong> No netspeak, meme spam, blatant OOC in IC, metagaming, metacommunications or patently absurd character concepts. This -is- SS13, so some leeway for strange or surreal concepts is allowed, but if you are unclear on something in this list, ask an admin.</li>
<br>
<li>- <strong>No ERP (cybersex).</strong> This extends to excessive public displays of affection like making out or grinding. We don't care how realistic it is for people on a colony to bump uglies.</li>
<br>
<li>- <strong>You are expected to be competent at a job that you sign up for.</strong> This doesn't mean people learning a job are unwelcome, but if you join as a doctor with no understanding of any aspect of medicine you can expect a jobban.</li>
<br>
<li>- <strong>Racism, sexism, questionable content and spamming on OOC mediums are not appreciated.</strong> If you're saying something you wouldn't in public, do it at your own peril.</li>
<br>
<li>- <strong>Admins reserve the right to ban you on their own terms.</strong> They will be held to scrutiny from the rest of the team and you can always appeal, but ultimately they're trusted to run the server.</li>
