Yonaguni-specific CONTRIBUTING.md:
- Anything that can safely target Bay and fits the Bay content requirements should go to Bay.
- Anything that breaks compatibility with Bay's dev branch should be as self-contained and modular as possible.
- PRs require a signoff from a maintainer before being merged by a second maintainer, or 24 hours to pass for discussion, whichever comes first.
- If your PR adds sprites or changes the map, it should include pictures of the end product.
- PRs should include a changelog - see the changelogs folder for a readme on how to use the system.
- New code or object definitions that are not modifying or replacing an existing system should go in code/modules/europa
- New sprites should go in the relative europa folder.
